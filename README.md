# 🏓 Pong Game (Python Turtle)

A simple 2-player Pong game made using Python's Turtle graphics module. This project was created as part of the 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Two players use keyboard keys to move their paddles up and down.
- The ball bounces off the top and bottom walls, as well as paddles.
